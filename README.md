# hw 1
Create github


# hw 2
hw : analogRGBControl.ino
- read de values of the potentiometers - use each value to directly control the RGB colors

# hw 3
a. The knocks must be detected with a passive buzzer that uses a 100ohms resistor. 
b. If it doesnâ€™t work, change the resistor. 
c. The time must be measured with millis(), not delay(). 
d. Remember, working with resistors you can usually vary the value a bit higher or lower if the recommended one does not produce the expected output. e. The code MUST be uploaded to GitHub and the README updated

# hw 4
- manipulation of 7-segments display with joystick

# hw 5
  file joystick+display.ino ,
  display_test.mp4
  ( this video have the same electric scheme as my board but mine does not work)
  broken.mp4 
  ( this video is the proof that my display(s) are somehow broken )
  -> use menu from display with joystick
