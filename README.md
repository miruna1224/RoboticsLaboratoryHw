# hw 1
first hw : analogRGBControl.ino
- read de values of the potentiometers - use each value to directly control the RGB colors

# hw 2
a. The knocks must be detected with a passive buzzer that uses a 100ohms resistor. 
b. If it doesnâ€™t work, change the resistor. 
c. The time must be measured with millis(), not delay(). 
d. Remember, working with resistors you can usually vary the value a bit higher or lower if the recommended one does not produce the expected output. e. The code MUST be uploaded to GitHub and the README updated

# hw 3
- manipulation of 7-segments display with joystick
